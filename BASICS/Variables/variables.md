# Python Variables Cheatsheet

This guide provides an overview of Python variables, their types, how to use them, and the operations that can be performed on them.

## What is a Variable in Python?

Variables are used to store and reference data in Python programs. Think of a variable as a labeled box where you can store different kinds of information. Once a value is assigned to a variable, it can be reused throughout the program.

```python
country = "United States"
year_founded = 1776
```

## Assigning a Value to a Variable

Assign a value using the `=` operator:

```python
age = 30
message = "Hello, World!"
```

### Variable Naming Rules:
- Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
- Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (no spaces or special characters).
- Case-sensitive (`Name` and `name` are different).

### Naming Conventions:
- Use descriptive names.
- Use snake_case (`user_name` instead of `username`).

## Python Data Types

Python variables can store different data types, including:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers.
  ```python
  age = 25
  ```
  
- **Floats**: Numbers with decimal points.
  ```python
  price = 99.99
  ```

- **Strings**: Sequence of characters.
  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  ```

- **Booleans**: True or False values.
  ```python
  is_active = True
  ```

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collection.
  ```python
  fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
  ```

- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collection.
  ```python
  coordinates = (10, 20)
  ```

## Python is Dynamically Typed

In Python, you do not need to declare variable types. The type of a variable can change during program execution. You can check a variable's type using the `type()` function:

```python
age = 42
print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Variable Operations

Python allows several operations on variables:

### Mathematical Operations
```python
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b        # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division
```

You can also use modulus (`%`) for remainder and exponentiation (`**`) for powers:

```python
remainder = a % b  # Modulus
power = a ** b     # Exponentiation
```

### String Operations

You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator:

```python
first_name = "Guido"
last_name = "van Rossum"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Output: Guido van Rossum
```

### Comparison Operations

Python supports comparison operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, and `!=` to compare values:

```python
x = 15
y = 20
print(x < y)   # Output: True
print(x == y)  # Output: False
```

## Variable Scope

### Global Scope:
Variables declared outside functions/classes have global scope and can be accessed anywhere.

```python
global_var = "I am global"
def show_var():
    print(global_var)
```

### Local Scope:
Variables declared inside functions/classes have local scope and can only be accessed within that block.

```python
def my_function():
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(local_var)
```

Accessing `local_var` outside the function will result in a `NameError`.
